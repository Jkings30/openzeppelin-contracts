Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect. The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \\\"step\\\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized. For example: [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding] ```solidity contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {     function initialize() initializer public {         __ERC20_init(\\\"MyToken\\\", \\\"MTK\\\");     } } contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {         __ERC20Permit_init(\\\"MyToken\\\");     } } ``` TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}. CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity. [CAUTION] ==== Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized. An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed: [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding] ```\",\"errors\":{\"AlreadyInitialized()\":[{\"details\":\"The contract is already initialized.\"}],\"NotInitializing()\":[{\"details\":\"The contract is not initializing.\"}]},\"events\":{\"Initialized(uint8)\":{\"details\":\"Triggered when the contract has been initialized or reinitialized.\"}},\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{},\"stateVariables\":{\"_initialized\":{\"details\":\"Indicates that the contract has been initialized.\"},\"_initializing\":{\"details\":\"Indicates that the contract is in the process of being initialized.\"}},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol\":\"Initializable\"},\"evmVersion\":\"paris\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[\":@ensdomains/=node_modules/@ensdomains/\",\":@openzeppelin/=node_modules/@openzeppelin/\",\":ds-test/=lib/forge-std/lib/ds-test/src/\",\":erc4626-tests/=lib/erc4626-tests/\",\":eth-gas-reporter/=node_modules/eth-gas-reporter/\",\":forge-std/=lib/forge-std/src/\",\":hardhat/=node_modules/hardhat/\",\":openzeppelin/=contracts/\"]},\"sources\":{\"contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x7d89239d08a563517094c6210962a3a874396afb3cb8f7a8e1813b091c96f359\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://1e9a7a395ca43d45a9a87de0dc1d941c7e55368bcf02a494edb63cb5a71c5e23\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmYtyt3BkaTgdtTng7GLWxftpru6xHgej9voiRCXy7V3BM\"]}},\"version\":1}","metadata":{"compiler":{"version":"0.8.27+commit.40a35a09"},"language":"Solidity","output":{"abi":[{"inputs":[],"type":"error","name":"AlreadyInitialized"},{"inputs":[],"type":"error","name":"NotInitializing"},{"inputs":[{"internalType":"uint8","name":"version","type":"uint8","indexed":false}],"type":"event","name":"Initialized","anonymous":false}],"devdoc":{"kind":"dev","methods":{},"version":1},"userdoc":{"kind":"user","methods":{},"version":1}},"settings":{"remappings":["@ensdomains/=node_modules/@ensdomains/","@openzeppelin/=node_modules/@openzeppelin/","ds-test/=lib/forge-std/lib/ds-test/src/","erc4626-tests/=lib/erc4626-tests/","eth-gas-reporter/=node_modules/eth-gas-reporter/","forge-std/=lib/forge-std/src/","hardhat/=node_modules/hardhat/","openzeppelin/=contracts/"],"optimizer":{"enabled":true,"runs":200},"metadata":{"bytecodeHash":"ipfs"},"compilationTarget":{"contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol":"Initializable"},"evmVersion":"paris","libraries":{}},"sources":{"contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol":{"keccak256":"0x7d89239d08a563517094c6210962a3a874396afb3cb8f7a8e1813b091c96f359","urls":["bzz-raw://1e9a7a395ca43d45a9a87de0dc1d941c7e55368bcf02a494edb63cb5a71c5e23","dweb:/ipfs/QmYtyt3BkaTgdtTng7GLWxftpru6xHgej9voiRCXy7V3BM"],"license":"MIT"}},"version":1},"id":134}
